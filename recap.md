# Project Recap: TechCEO Content Automator

This file summarizes the key accomplishments and final state of the project for future reference.

## 1. Key Accomplishments

- **Core Automation Achieved:** We successfully built a Python script (`gemini_main.py`) that automates the entire content creation workflow:
    1.  It scrapes a tool's website for context.
    2.  It uses Google's Gemini AI to generate high-quality content based on a detailed template (`plan.md`).
    3.  It formats the output into a WordPress-compatible CSV file, ready for direct upload.

- **Solved Complex Formatting:** After many iterations, we solved the WordPress CSV importer's strict requirements by using a simple, clean template (`test.csv`) and having the script populate it. This proved to be the most reliable method.

- **Created a User Submission Form:** We built a modern, dark-themed, and self-contained HTML form (`tool_submission_form.html`) that can be embedded directly into a WordPress page to capture new tool submissions from the community.

- **Professionalized the Script:** We refactored the script to accept command-line arguments, removing the need to edit the file for each run. This makes it suitable for future deployment and automation (e.g., being called by a webhook).

- **Cleaned and Documented:** We cleaned the repository by removing all unnecessary files and created a comprehensive `README.md` that details the project setup, usage, and file structure.

## 2. Final Project State

The repository is now clean and contains the following key files:

-   `gemini_main.py`: The final, argument-driven Python script.
-   `test.csv`: The simplified, working template for the CSV output.
-   `plan.md`: The master template that guides the AI's content generation.
-   `tool_submission_form.html`: The embeddable HTML form for user submissions.
-   `README.md`: The main documentation file with setup and usage instructions.
-   `deploy.md`: A guide outlining options for future deployment.
-   `.env`: The file for storing the `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
-   `requirements.txt`: The list of Python dependencies.
