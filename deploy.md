# Deployment and Webhook Strategy

This guide outlines several options for deploying the Python script so it can be triggered by a webhook from your WordPress form.

## 1. Key Challenges

*   **Playwright's Dependencies:** Playwright is not a simple library; it requires browser binaries and system libraries to be installed. This makes it tricky to run in some lightweight serverless environments.
*   **Persistent File Storage:** The script needs to append data to the *same* `tools_gemini.csv` file every time it runs. Many modern hosting platforms are "stateless," meaning they don't have a permanent hard drive that you can write to.

## 2. Preparing the Script for Deployment

Before deploying, we should simplify the script by embedding the `plan.md` template directly into the code. This removes the need to upload and manage a separate template file, which makes deployment much easier.

**I will perform this action for you in the `gemini_main.py` script.**

## 3. Deployment Options

Here are the best options, from the most straightforward to the most "cloud-native."

### Option 1: The Simplest Approach (Small VPS)

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a small, private server in the cloud. It's like having a dedicated computer that's always on.

*   **How it Works:** You rent a server, set up the Python environment, and run the script inside a simple web server wrapper (like Flask). Because you have a full Linux machine, you can install Playwright's dependencies easily and write directly to the filesystem.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Easiest to Understand:** It works just like your local computer.
    *   **Persistent Storage:** You can write the CSV file directly to the server's disk. No complex setup needed.
    *   **Full Control:** No issues installing Playwright or any other dependencies.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Requires Manual Setup:** You are responsible for setting up the server and security.
    *   **Not Free:** The cheapest servers cost around **$5-$7 per month**. (Providers: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr).
*   **Best For:** Users who want the most direct and reliable path to getting this working without dealing with the complexities of serverless platforms.

### Option 2: The Modern "Cloud" Approach (Serverless Functions)

This uses a service like Google Cloud Functions or AWS Lambda, where you upload your code and it only runs when a webhook comes in.

*   **How it Works:** You would create a "function" that contains your Python script. The platform provides the webhook URL. However, because these functions are stateless, you cannot save the CSV file locally. You must use a separate cloud storage service.
*   **The CSV Workflow:**
    1.  Function is triggered by the webhook.
    2.  It downloads `tools_gemini.csv` from a cloud storage bucket (like Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3).
    3.  It appends the new data in memory.
    4.  It uploads the newly modified CSV file back to the storage bucket, overwriting the old one.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extremely Cheap/Free:** The free tiers are so generous that this workflow would likely cost **$0 per month**.
    *   **Fully Managed:** No servers to maintain at all.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Very Complex Setup:** Getting Playwright to run in this environment is difficult and requires using custom Docker containers.
    *   **Requires Cloud Storage:** You have to set up and manage a separate storage bucket for the CSV file, which adds another layer of complexity.
*   **Best For:** Developers comfortable with cloud services who want a highly scalable, cost-effective solution and are willing to tackle the technical challenges.

### Option 3: The Middle Ground (PaaS with a Docker Container)

Platforms like **Render** or **Railway** let you deploy applications easily from a GitHub repository. By using Docker, you can solve the Playwright dependency issue.

*   **How it Works:** You create a `Dockerfile` that tells the platform exactly how to build your environment (including installing Playwright's dependencies). You would still need to use a cloud storage bucket for the CSV, as these platforms also have temporary filesystems.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Easier than a VPS:** The platform handles the server management for you.
    *   **Solves the Playwright Problem:** Docker gives you the control you need for dependencies.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Still requires Cloud Storage for the CSV.**
    *   Free tiers may be limited or "spin down" after inactivity, causing a delay on the first request.
*   **Best For:** Users who are familiar with Git and want an automated deployment workflow without managing a full server.

## 4. Recommendation

For your use case, where simplicity and reliability are key, **Option 1 (the Small VPS) is the most direct path to success.**

While it's not free, the low monthly cost eliminates the major complexities of handling Playwright and the persistent CSV file that you would face with serverless or PaaS solutions.
