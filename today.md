Here are the questions from our last session, along with my analysis and answers.

---

**1. is it possible to get a pic from the internet that matches the tool or site ?**

> **Answer:** This is a great idea for a new feature. The current script is designed to scrape only text. To add image fetching, I would need to implement a new mechanism, such as searching the scraped web page for a logo or a representative image (like an `og:image` meta tag) and then downloading it. This is possible but would require additional code and potentially new libraries.

**2. AIC Contributor - will it display the link of the user input/links on the tool request form? Where can we see the form?**

> **Answer:** The script currently accepts the contributor's name as a simple text string (e.g., "TechCEO"). It doesn't support links for the contributor field. The form you're referring to is the `tool_submission_form.html` file in the project directory. It's a standalone file designed to be embedded on a website to collect tool suggestions. The data from that form would be sent to a server or a service (which is not yet built) and then used to run this script.

**3. Can we do an example where it pulls a YouTube video? Preferably less than 1 year old and over 30k views? Or shows an actual person teaching it?**

> **Answer:** Similar to image fetching, this would be a significant new feature. The script does not currently interact with YouTube. To implement this, I would need to use the official YouTube Data API, which would involve setting up API keys and writing new code to search for videos based on your criteria (age, view count, content).

**4. Fun fact - didnt seem to fun or interesting**

> **Answer:** I agree. The quality of the "Fun Fact" section depends entirely on the instructions given to the AI. This is an easy fix. I can modify the prompt in `gemini_main.py` to specifically ask for a more surprising, engaging, or historical fact about the tool or its creators.

**5. Pricing - didnt show pricing. Only**

> **Answer:** You're right. The current template has a generic pricing section. Getting accurate, dynamic pricing is challenging because it's often presented in complex tables or requires user interaction on a website. I can improve this by modifying the AI prompt to have it specifically search for and summarize any pricing information it finds in the scraped text.

**6. Prompt - can we make content output a little easier for newnpeolle to the space to understand.**

> **Answer:** Absolutely. This is a straightforward prompt engineering task. I can update the main instructions for the AI in `gemini_main.py` to explicitly request a simpler, more accessible tone that avoids jargon and is geared towards a beginner audience.

**7. Real-world example- make poles more relatable**

> **Answer:** This is another excellent point that I can address by improving the prompt. I will modify the instructions for the "Real-World Examples" section to ask the AI to generate scenarios that a typical student, small business owner, or hobbyist would find more relatable.

**8. backend- can we auto set dev to techceo? Or make a new one that says auto? (Backend - tool author***)**

> **Answer:** Yes. The script already does this. The default contributor is set to "TechCEO". If you run the script without specifying a `--contributor`, it will automatically use "TechCEO". Regarding "tool author", the script cannot automatically determine the author of the tool; the contributor is meant to be the person *submitting* the tool to your platform.

**9. FAQ add bullet points**

> **Answer:** The instructions in the template do ask the AI to create a list of 3 bullet points for the FAQ. However, to make this more explicit and ensure the AI uses the desired formatting, I can add the `●` symbol directly into the template for that section, just like in the "Pros" and "Cons" sections.

**10. Initial warnings - change icon to something more colorful like**

> **Answer:** Yes, this is a very simple change. I can replace the '⚠️' emoji in the template with a more colorful one like '🔴' or '💡'.
